**Subject:** Proposed Solutions and Code Snippets for Resolving Databricks Memory-Related Issues

Hi Team,

I've gathered some strategies and code snippets to help address the memory-related issues we're encountering in Databricks, where tasks frequently fail with Python kernel unresponsiveness and driver restarts. Here's a summary of the issues and the proposed solutions with corresponding code examples.

---

**Summary of Issues and Attempted Solutions:**
- Errors include "Python kernel is unresponsive" and "Spark driver restarting."
- We’ve tried restarting the cluster, increasing Spark driver memory, changing runtime versions, adjusting `maxRowsInMemory`, and running tasks separately, but these changes haven't resolved the errors.
- The cluster's CPU and memory usage maxes out during these tasks, suggesting we’re hitting resource limitations.

### Proposed Solutions with Code Snippets

1. **Efficient Use of DataFrame APIs**
   - Avoid using `.collect()` on large DataFrames as it loads all data into the driver, risking memory overflow. Instead, use `.show()` to inspect data, and use projections to minimize data loaded at any point.

   ```python
   # Avoid collect() on large DataFrames; instead, use show() to view sample rows
   df.limit(10).show()

   # Use projection (select specific columns) to minimize memory usage
   selected_df = df.select("column1", "column2").filter(df["column3"] > 100)
   ```

2. **Broadcast Join for Small DataFrames**
   - If joining a smaller DataFrame with a large one, use `broadcast()` to avoid shuffling large amounts of data.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import functions as F
   small_df = spark.table("small_table")
   large_df = spark.table("large_table")
   result_df = large_df.join(F.broadcast(small_df), "join_key")
   ```

3. **Cache and Unpersist DataFrames**
   - Use `cache()` or `persist()` only when necessary, and make sure to unpersist the DataFrame after use to free up memory.

   ```python
   # Cache DataFrame
   df_cached = df.cache()

   # Use the DataFrame multiple times...

   # Unpersist to free memory
   df_cached.unpersist()
   ```

4. **Adjust Spark Configurations for Memory**
   - Increase memory allocations for executors and drivers and adjust shuffle partitions based on cluster capacity.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder \
       .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g") \
       .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g") \
       .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "100") \
       .getOrCreate()
   ```

5. **Enable Autoscaling and Consider Spot Instances (Cluster Config)**
   - In Databricks, enable **autoscaling** in the cluster settings to dynamically add worker nodes when load spikes.
   - If our subscription allows, use **spot instances** for additional nodes at a lower cost.

6. **Partition Large Datasets by a Key**
   - Partition large datasets by a relevant key (e.g., date or region) to reduce memory usage and processing time.

   ```python
   # Partition data by 'date' column when saving
   df.write \
       .partitionBy("date") \
       .format("parquet") \
       .save("/path/to/partitioned_data")
   ```

7. **Reduce Data Shuffles with Repartitioning**
   - If tasks are skewed or have high memory demands, repartition the data by a key to balance the load.

   ```python
   # Repartition DataFrame by 'column_key' to reduce skew and memory usage
   df_repartitioned = df.repartition("column_key")
   ```

8. **Optimize UDFs (User-Defined Functions)**
   - Avoid Python UDFs, which can consume high memory, and use Spark’s built-in SQL functions wherever possible.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import functions as F

   # Inefficient UDF approach
   # from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType
   # def add_one(x):
   #     return x + 1
   # add_one_udf = F.udf(add_one, IntegerType())
   # df = df.withColumn("new_column", add_one_udf(df["column"]))

   # Efficient approach using Spark SQL function
   df = df.withColumn("new_column", F.col("column") + 1)
   ```

9. **Monitoring with Spark UI**
   - Use the **Spark UI** in Databricks to monitor task-level metrics and identify any stages with high memory usage or skewed tasks.

10. **Incremental Processing with Smaller Batches**
   - If processing a large dataset, split it into smaller, manageable batches to reduce memory load per task.

   ```python
   # Process data in small batches
   for batch in range(0, 100, 10):
       batch_df = df.filter((df["id"] >= batch) & (df["id"] < batch + 10))
       # Process each batch_df independently
   ```

Implementing these changes should help manage memory more effectively and potentially resolve the current issues. If these steps don’t fully address the problems, upgrading to a higher subscription tier with additional resources might be necessary.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these steps further or need help with implementation.
