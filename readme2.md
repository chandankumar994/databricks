**Summary of Errors and Previous Attempts:**
- We’ve encountered frequent errors, including "Python kernel is unresponsive" and "Spark driver restarting," likely due to resource limitations and out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
- Attempts to restart the cluster, increase Spark driver memory, change runtime versions, and adjust `maxRowsInMemory` didn’t fully resolve the issues.
- Observed that the cluster's CPU and memory usage maxes out during these tasks, suggesting potential resource constraints.

### Proposed Solutions with Code Snippets:

**1. Efficient Use of DataFrame APIs:**
   - Avoid using `.collect()` on large DataFrames, which can cause the driver to run out of memory.
   - Use filtering and projection to reduce the amount of data in memory.

   ```python
   # Avoid collect() on large DataFrames; instead, use show() to view sample rows
   df.limit(10).show()

   # Use projection (select specific columns) to minimize memory usage
   selected_df = df.select("column1", "column2").filter(df["column3"] > 100)
   ```

**2. Broadcast Join for Small DataFrames:**
   - When joining a small DataFrame with a larger one, broadcasting the smaller DataFrame can reduce memory usage.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import functions as F

   # Broadcast join
   small_df = spark.table("small_table")
   large_df = spark.table("large_table")
   result_df = large_df.join(F.broadcast(small_df), "join_key")
   ```

**3. Cache and Unpersist DataFrames:**
   - Use `cache()` or `persist()` only when necessary, and always unpersist once finished to free memory.

   ```python
   # Cache DataFrame
   df_cached = df.cache()

   # Use the DataFrame multiple times...

   # Unpersist to free memory
   df_cached.unpersist()
   ```

**4. Adjust Spark Configurations for Memory:**
   - Increase memory allocations for executors and driver, and adjust shuffle partitions to optimize resource usage.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder \
       .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g") \
       .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g") \
       .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "100") \
       .getOrCreate()
   ```

**5. Enable Autoscaling and Consider Spot Instances:**
   - **Enable Autoscaling** in the Databricks Cluster Configuration to automatically add nodes based on demand.
   - If available, consider **spot instances** for cost-effective scaling.

**6. Partition Large Datasets by a Key:**
   - Partitioning large datasets by a relevant key can reduce memory demands per task.

   ```python
   # Partition data by 'date' column when saving
   df.write \
       .partitionBy("date") \
       .format("parquet") \
       .save("/path/to/partitioned_data")
   ```

**7. Reduce Data Shuffles with Repartitioning:**
   - For skewed data, repartitioning by a key can balance memory load and prevent individual tasks from using too much memory.

   ```python
   # Repartition DataFrame by 'column_key' to reduce skew and memory usage
   df_repartitioned = df.repartition("column_key")
   ```

**8. Optimize UDFs (User-Defined Functions):**
   - Use built-in Spark SQL functions instead of Python UDFs to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import functions as F

   # Example using Spark SQL function instead of Python UDF
   df = df.withColumn("new_column", F.col("column") + 1)
   ```

**9. Monitoring with Spark UI:**
   - Use the Spark UI in Databricks to check for task-level metrics, looking for tasks with high "Duration" and "GC Time," which can indicate memory issues or data skew.

**10. Incremental Processing with Smaller Batches:**
   - Break large datasets into smaller, manageable batches to reduce memory load per task.

   ```python
   # Process data in small batches
   for batch in range(0, 100, 10):
       batch_df = df.filter((df["id"] >= batch) & (df["id"] < batch + 10))
       # Process each batch_df independently
   ```
If these steps don’t fully resolve the issues, we may need to consider upgrading to a higher subscription tier to provide additional resources for these tasks.
